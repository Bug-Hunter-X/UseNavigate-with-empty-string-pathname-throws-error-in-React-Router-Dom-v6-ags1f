The issue stems from the difference in how `useNavigate` handles the absence of a pathname versus an empty string pathname.  To resolve this, instead of passing `{ pathname: '' }`, simply call `navigate()` without arguments to go to the root path. This leverages the intended behavior of `useNavigate` for navigating to the root. 

```javascript
// Incorrect: Throws an error
navigate({ pathname: '' });

// Correct: Navigates to the root
navigate();
```

Alternatively, if you specifically need to check if the pathname is empty before navigating, you can implement a conditional check:
```javascript
const navigate = useNavigate();
const pathname = '';

if (pathname) {
  navigate({ pathname });
} else {
  navigate();
}
```
