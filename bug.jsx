In React Router Dom v6, the `useNavigate` hook returns a function that, when called without arguments, performs a navigation to the root path ('/').  However, if you attempt to call it with an object containing a `pathname` property that is an empty string ('') in an attempt to navigate to the root, it throws an error.  This is because an empty string pathname is interpreted differently than no pathname argument at all.  The error you encounter will vary depending on how error handling is implemented in your application, but may look similar to this:  `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` or a similar error indicating that the router is unable to handle an empty string route.
